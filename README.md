# Responsive Layout Project
This project demonstrates how to create a responsive web layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox. It is designed to showcase the key concepts of responsive design, allowing the layout to adapt seamlessly across various screen sizes and devices.

# Project Overview
This project was created to practice building responsive web layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox. It provides a hands-on example of how to apply modern CSS techniques to create flexible and adaptable user interfaces that respond to different screen sizes.

# Technologies Used
  * HTML5
  * CSS3 (Grid, Flexbox, Media Queries)

# Features
 * Responsive Design: Adapts layout to fit small, medium, and large screens.
 * CSS Grid Layout: Used for complex and larger grid-based layouts.
 * Flexbox Layout: Used for single-dimensional layouts, especially within grid items.
 * Media Queries: Apply specific styles based on screen size breakpoints.

# Usage
  * Grid: The main structure of the page is designed using CSS Grid to provide a flexible and consistent layout. Grid is especially useful for multi-dimensional layouts, allowing easy row and column adjustments.
  * Flexbox: Flexbox is used inside individual grid items for aligning elements in a single dimension, providing more control over spacing, alignment, and distribution.
  * Media Queries: Media queries are applied to make the layout responsive, changing the grid and flex properties based on screen width (e.g., desktop, tablet, and mobile views).
